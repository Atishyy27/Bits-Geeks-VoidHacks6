# **Introduction**

The goal of this hackathon project is to develop an Internship Management System (IMS) that addresses the challenges faced by universities in managing internships. The system will enhance tracking, communication, administrative efficiency, and compliance, ultimately improving the internship experience for students, faculty, and administrators.

## **Technical Stack**  

1. **Frontend Development**: Used React.js for developing the front end of our web-application.  
2. **Backend Development**: Node.js is used for server-side logic and database management.  
3. **Database**: Utilized MongoDB for storing user data, reports, and internship records.  
4. **Mobile Application**: Developed a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter.

## **Implementation Steps**  

### **Requirement Analysis**  

- Conduct brainstorming sessions with stakeholders (students, faculty, administration) to finalize the requirements.

### **Design Phase**  

- Create wireframes and architecture diagrams for web applications.  

- Define user roles (students, mentors, coordinators) and their respective functionalities.

### **Development Phase**  

- Set up the development environment and begin coding based on the defined architecture.  
- Focus on developing core features first (tracking dashboard, communication platform).

### **Testing Phase**  

- Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing with selected users to ensure functionality meets expectations.

### **Training & Support**  

- Provide training sessions for users on how to navigate the system effectively.  
- Establish a support channel for troubleshooting post-deployment issues.

## **Challenges Addressed**  

1. **Complex Tracking**: The dashboard will allow real-time monitoring of intern progress.  
2. **Communication Gaps**: Centralized messaging will ensure timely interactions between all parties involved.  
3. **Administrative Burden**: Automation of report generation and mentor assignments will reduce manual workload.  
4. **Compliance Issues**: A digital repository will simplify record-keeping and compliance checks.
