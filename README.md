## **Technical Stack**  

1. **Frontend Development**: Used React.js for developing the front end of our web application.  
2. **Backend Development**: Node.js is used for server-side logic and database management.  
3. **Database**: Utilized MongoDB for storing user data, reports, and internship records.  
4. **Mobile Application**: Developed a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter.

## **Implementation Steps**  

### **Requirement Analysis**  

- Conduct brainstorming sessions with stakeholders (students, faculty, administration) to finalize the requirements.

### **Design Phase**  

- Create wireframes and architecture diagrams for web applications.  
- Define user roles (students, mentors, coordinators) and their respective functionalities.

### **Development Phase**  

- Set up the development environment and begin coding based on the defined architecture.  
- Focus on developing core features first (tracking dashboard, communication platform).

### **Testing Phase**  

- Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing with selected users to ensure functionality meets expectations.
