## **Technical Stack**  

1. **Frontend Development**: Used React.js for developing the front end of our web-application.  
2. **Backend Development**: Node.js is used for server-side logic and database management.  
3. **Database**: Utilized MongoDB for storing user data, reports, and internship records.  
4. **Mobile Application**: Developed a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter.

## **Implementation Steps**  

### **Requirement Analysis**  

- Conduct brainstorming sessions with stakeholders (students, faculty, administration) to finalize the requirements.

### **Design Phase**  

- Create wireframes and architecture diagrams for web applications.  

- Define user roles (students, mentors, coordinators) and their respective functionalities.

### **Development Phase**  

- Set up the development environment and begin coding based on the defined architecture.  
- Focus on developing core features first (tracking dashboard, communication platform).

### **Testing Phase**  

- Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing with selected users to ensure functionality meets expectations.

### **Training & Support**  

- Provide training sessions for users on how to navigate the system effectively.  
- Establish a support channel for troubleshooting post-deployment issues.

## **Hereâ€™s a brief introduction to each feature of the Internship Management System (IMS) based on the provided codebase**:
1. **Real-Time Tracking**
This feature provides a dashboard for faculty to monitor student progress in real-time. It allows faculty members to review submitted assignments and certificates, ensuring that they can track the status of internships effectively.
2. **Centralized Communication Platform**
The system includes a messaging feature that connects students, faculty, and administration. This facilitates timely feedback and approvals, reducing communication gaps and ensuring that all parties are informed about important updates.
3. **Administrative Automation**
This feature automates the assignment of internal mentors to interns, streamlining the process of mentor allocation. Additionally, it includes tools for generating reports on student progress and compliance with internship requirements, reducing the administrative burden on faculty.
4. **Compliance Management**
The system maintains a digital repository for all internship-related documents. This ensures that students meet the necessary requirements and simplifies record-keeping and compliance checks for faculty and administration.
5. **Mentor Dashboard**
Mentors have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can submit evaluations and marks for interns' reports. This feature enhances the mentor's ability to provide feedback and track the performance of their assigned interns.
6. **Internship Coordinator Interface**
This interface allows internship coordinators to view interns' progress and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on intern records. It provides coordinators with the tools they need to manage internship placements effectively.
7. **Assignment Management**
Faculty can create and manage assignments for students. This feature allows for the submission of assignments every 30 days, ensuring that students are regularly evaluated and that their progress is monitored.
8. **Fortnightly Reports**
The system generates fortnightly reports for interns, summarizing their progress and activities over the past 15 days. This feature helps in maintaining a consistent evaluation of intern performance.
9. **Internship Details View**
This feature provides detailed information about each internship application, including student details, application status, and document statuses. It allows faculty to view and manage internship applications comprehensively.
10. **Approved Internships View**
Faculty can view all approved internship applications, including details about the student and the internship. This feature helps in tracking which students have secured internships and their respective statuses.
11. **Guidelines for Internships**
The system includes a section that outlines internship guidelines for students. This feature educates students about the expectations and requirements of their internships, helping them prepare adequately.
12. **Document Management**
The system allows for the uploading and management of various documents related to internships, such as attendance records, application forms, and undertaking documents. This ensures that all necessary paperwork is organized and accessible.
13. **Email Notifications**
The system sends email notifications to students and faculty regarding important updates, such as the approval of internship applications. This feature enhances communication and keeps all stakeholders informed.
14. **Statistics and Reporting**
The system provides statistical insights into internship placements, including overall statistics, year-wise distributions, and class-wise distributions. This feature helps in analyzing trends and making informed decisions regarding internship programs.

## **Conclusion**  

This Internship Management System aims to revolutionize how internships are managed at universities by leveraging technology to solve existing challenges. By focusing on real-time tracking, streamlined communication, and efficient administrative processes, this project will enhance the internship experience for all stakeholders involved. The hackathon provides an excellent opportunity to prototype this solution rapidly while fostering collaboration among participants.
